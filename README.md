# Installing
For IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)

VCS -> Get from Version Control... -> Paste the URL of this repository

For Eclipse

File -> Import -> Git -> Projects from Git (With Smart Import) -> Clone URI -> paste URL of this repository into the URI box -> Click next a bunch, setting directory at your own discression, Master branch from origin. All else default -> Finish

For both:

Drag your .java files from the assignment into the tester package.

In case your IDE does not automatically set package name, change your package name to COMP250A1_W2020

Regularly update the tester (pull the repository). Your assignment files will be ignored.
